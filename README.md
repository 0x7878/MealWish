# MealWish

> [!WARNING]  
> Not even in alpha. Work in progress

The idea behind **MealWish** is to provide you and your family (household) with a tool to manage
your meal wishes and your meals. Each member can choose from a list of what he or she would like
to eat for the next few weeks. The chef can then decide which dishes he or she will cook in the
following days. Users can see the plan in the overview, and members responsible for shopping can
also plan what they have to buy.

## Requirement

MealWish is a REACT application wrapped in a web component that seamlessly integrates with
HomeAssistant and gets updates like the current user. The database (backend) needs to be
installed separately.
