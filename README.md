# MealWish

> [!WARNING]  
> This is in beta now and should not be used in production.

The idea behind **MealWish** is to provide a tool to manage your meal wishes and your meals. 
Each member can choose from a list of what he or she would like to eat for the next few weeks. 
The chef or the household can then decide which dishes he or she will cook in the
following days. Users can see the plan in the overview, and members who are responsible for 
shopping can also plan what they have to buy.

## Requirement

MealWish is a REACT application wrapped in a web component that seamlessly integrates with
HomeAssistant and gets updates like the current user. The database (backend) needs to be
installed separately.
